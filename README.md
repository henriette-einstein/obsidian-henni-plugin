# Obsidian Henni Plugin

Henni watches your vault for new media and keeps companion notes in sync. It can scan existing images, PDFs, and other digital assets, generate note stubs from customizable templates, and automatically organize the output into folders you configure.

## Installation (BRAT)

1. Install the **[Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tester (BRAT)](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)** community plugin in Obsidian and enable it.
2. Open BRAT settings → *Add Beta plugin*.
3. Paste this repository URL and confirm: `https://github.com/arminpfarr/obsidian-henni-plugin`
4. BRAT will fetch the latest build and place it in your vault’s plugin folder.
5. Back in Obsidian, enable **Obsidian Henni Plugin** in *Settings → Community plugins*.

Once active, visit the plugin’s settings panel to choose target folders, file extensions, and per-media note templates.
